//! Outbound webhook delivery.
//!
//! When a payment reaches a terminal state we POST a signed JSON event to the
//! merchant's `webhook_url`. To let receivers prove both authenticity and
//! freshness, every request carries two headers:
//!
//! - `X-StellarGate-Timestamp`: the Unix time (seconds) the event was signed.
//! - `X-StellarGate-Signature`: the hex HMAC-SHA256 of `"{timestamp}.{body}"`
//!   (Stripe-style), keyed with the shared `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
//! - `X-StellarGate-Event`: a convenience copy of the `event` field from the
//!   body, included so receivers can route cheaply before parsing JSON.
//!   **This header is not covered by the HMAC signature.** It can be altered
//!   in transit without invalidating the signature. Receivers that make
//!   security-sensitive decisions MUST route on the `event` field inside the
//!   verified JSON body, not on this header.
//!
//! Binding the signature to the timestamp stops a captured request from being
//! replayed indefinitely: a receiver recomputes the signature over the same
//! `"{timestamp}.{body}"` string and rejects timestamps that fall outside a
//! small tolerance window. See the README "Verifying webhooks" section for the
//! verification recipe and recommended window.
